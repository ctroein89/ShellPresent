# ShellPresent

What if I told you that I could run a dev demo as a presentation in terminal? I want to be able to display a slide, and use that as both note-for-self and as a visual indicator of where I am in a tech demo. The primary use case is a tech demo that I'll be doing in the coming weeks, where I plan to do some live coding.

## Hasn't someone done this already?

Probably, but this is being built for fun.

## Usage

```
sh present.sh -f [slides]
```

Slides are split by ---.

Code blockes are delineated by \`\`\`. Note that \`\`\` does funny things to syntax highlighting, so I have to present it here escaped with slashes.
